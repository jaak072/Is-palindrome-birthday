# Palindrome Birthday

 ## Using HTML,CSS and vanillaJS. Some ideas which i can do. To Create this Pailndromebirthday finder.
- 1.)Take user's birthday.
 - 2.) Tell whether user was born on a palindrome day or not..
 - 3.) You can put dates in MM/DD/YYYY format, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YY format etc. to check if they have any chance.
 - 4.)If not, then its tell you what is the nearest date from their birthdate which is a palindrome date.
